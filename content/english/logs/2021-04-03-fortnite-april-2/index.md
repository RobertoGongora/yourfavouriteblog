*Fortnite, I know...*

## Achievements

- Won my first solo match! It was also my 2nd-ever match, so my ego has been boosted.
- Reached lv. 6
- Played with my niece, had lots of fun :)

## TIL

- I like using the bow and arrow.
- Crafting is weird in this game, I need to improve.
- There are NPCs now? Also quests?
- Fortnite also has a single-player PvE mode, might be worth checking it out.
