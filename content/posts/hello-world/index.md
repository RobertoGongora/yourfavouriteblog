## Who am I

Hi, I'm Roberto Gongora, but I like being called Rob. I'm a software developer specialised in web applications and infrastructure. I also love videogames, cooking and writing.

## Why am I starting this blog

This is more of a personal achievement, I want to flex my writing muscles a bit and get better at it.

## Why would you care

I don't know, that's a you problem :)

## Things I would love to write about

In no particular order:

* **Web development topics**, useful tips and tricks.
* **Software**, cool stuff I find that helps me get better at what I do.
* **Teaching**, techniques I've developed over the years that only experience can teach.
* **Life**, personal goals, achievements, and overall nice stuff I get to experience and want to share.
* **Videogame Development**, share my experience as a rookie game developer on my way to develop my first VR game.
* **Gaming Logs**, these will list what I did on my last play session and my goals for the next ones. I've found out that gaming with purpose helps me enjoy it.
* **Traveling**, my wife and I will be traveling a lot in the future, so I'd love to write about our experiences, things we learn about different cultures and food.
* **Cooking**, maybe I'll share some of my secret recipes :) For the longest time I've been super protective of my recipes, but I've found that: a) nobody cares, b) everyone cooks different, so it doesn't really matter.

## My promise

This site is hosted using GitHub Pages, this source code is available for anyone to explore and even suggest changes if I write something that's inaccurate or there's a typo.

I'm also never going to monetise my personal site, so all resources found here are and will forever be free of charge. My intention with this is to **share** my experiences with anyone who wants to read them.

This site is protected through Cloudflare, and since it's basically serverless there are no worries of malware ever appearing or bots taking over. My security settings for this site are particularly strict, and I will keep an eye on my DNS analytics to strenghten them if necessary.

I also hate trackers and ads, so this site will forever be free of annoying third-party scripts, pixels, ads, and anything that doesn't add to your experience as a reader. I'm also open to suggestions (via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/RobertoGongora/yourfavouriteblog/issues)) to add/remove anything that's seen as problematic :)

## Next Steps

I would love a way to communicate with you, so I've been thinking of ways to add comments or discussions to my posts, but I really don't want to use third-party services for this, so I'm open to suggestions on that front. If I don't find anything, I'll end up developing my own solution (and of course, it will be documented here)

## Shameless Plugs

My wife has also started her own blog, which is set up in the same way this one is. Meaning, you can expect the same level of openness and privacy. You can check her blog at <https://thisismy.blog>
