Achievements Won my first solo match! It was also my 2nd-ever match, so my ego has been boosted. Reached lv. 6 Played with my niece, had lots of fun :) TIL I like using the bow and arrow. Crafting is weird in this game, I need to improve. There are NPCs now? Also quests? Fortnite also has a single-player PvE mode, might be worth checking it out.</description></item></channel></rss>
