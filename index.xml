I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer specialised in web applications and infrastructure. I also love videogames, cooking and writing.
Why am I starting this blog? I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to start a blog for a long time, but I never dared to do so. I love writing, and this is an excellent platform to do it.</description></item><item><title>Fortnite - April 2</title><link>https://yourfavourite.blog/logs/2021-04-03-fortnite-april-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Apr 2021 22:44:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yourfavourite.blog/logs/2021-04-03-fortnite-april-2/</guid><description>Fortnite, I know&amp;hellip;
Achievements Won my first solo match! It was also my 2nd-ever match, so my ego has been boosted. Reached lv. 6 Played with my niece, had lots of fun :) TIL I like using the bow and arrow. Crafting is weird in this game, I need to improve. There are NPCs now? Also quests? Fortnite also has a single-player PvE mode, might be worth checking it out.</description></item><item><title>Elite Dangerous - April 1</title><link>https://yourfavourite.blog/logs/2021-04-02-elite-dangerous-april-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 21:30:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yourfavourite.blog/logs/2021-04-02-elite-dangerous-april-1/</guid><description>Achievements Reached Cadet with the Federation (ew) Grinding in the Ceos/Sothis systems.
